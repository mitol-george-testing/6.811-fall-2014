Mid-semester Presentations Guidelines
-------------------------------------

Each team will give a 15-minute presentation to share its work with the rest of the class. Signups will be arranged in class. We will have an expert design review panel, who will attend each presentation and give feedback.

We are allowing friends of the course to attend our mid-semester presentations -- this is a public event. The attendees understand that your projects are currently in their mid-stages. You may wish to be discreet about certain kinds of personal information about your client, or to blur photos.

### Instructions

*   Please remember to only refer to clients by their first name.
*   You may wish to show your team's project video during the presentation.
*   We encourage all of your team member's to have a speaking role during the presentation.

### Deliverables

In addition to the presentation, you should upload your slides or other presentation materials.

### Presentation Contents

Your presentation need not be highly formal, but it must cover each aspect of what your team has accomplished so far. We recommend a length of 12-15 minutes; we will stop you at exactly 15 minutes.We recommend the following structure:

*   Introduce yourselves.
*   Contextual Inquiry (45 minutes): Describe your client and his/her abilities, disabilities and activity goals. Use the HAAT model. Present the qualitative and quantitative success metrics that you chose. This section should correspond to Section 1 of the Mid-Semester Report.
*   Project Organization and Progress (~45 minutes): Show early sketches, mockups, or prototypes and your client's reactions to them. Describe your iterative design process to date and how you've narrowed down ideas and the resources (facilities, people) you've made contact with so far. This section should correspond to Section 2 of the Mid-Semester Report.
*   Project Plans (~34 minutes): Describe your timeline for the rest of the semester and each team member's past and future contributions and roles.

### Grading

Teams will be evaluated primarily on the quality of their contextual inquiries, ideas, and plans, but also on their presentation contents and style and their ability to answer questions. The panelists' feedback will also contribute to the grading.

As audience members, each student in the class should also be prepared to ask good questions and provide constructive suggestions.

Each team will receive written feedback about their presentation, along with a letter grade, the week after the panels.

Final Presentations Guidelines
------------------------------

Each team will give a 9-minute presentation. As per the course syllabus, the end of semester presentation is 10% of the final grade.

### Presentation Guideline

*   Introduce your client and the assistive technology challenge.
*   Briefly show/describe your earlier prototypes and the evaluation results of your experiments.
*   Describe/demonstrate your final prototype and how it performed, according to your experiments and success metrics.
*   Describe what you learned as a team about assistive technology design and engineering and from your client.
